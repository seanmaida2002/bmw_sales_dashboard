## Step 1: Data Cleaning & Validation
In Excel, I performed data cleaning and validation to make sure there are no duplicates, fixed any inconsistencies and improperly formatted data. 

## Step 2: Database Setup & Data Ingestion (MySQL)
I started the project by setting up a relational database environment in MySQL.
- Created a dedicated database for the project
- Designed and implemented a structured table schema based on the CSV dataset
- Defined appropriate data types
- Imported the cleaned sales dataset from the CSV into the MySQL table
- Verified successful data load and row counts
